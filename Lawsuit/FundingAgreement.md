**AND WHEREAS** the Funder wishes to provide financial assistance to the Plaintiff to pursue the Lawsuit in exchange for a portion of the proceeds, pursuant to the terms set out herein;

**NOW THEREFORE** in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, the Parties agree as follows:

## 1. DEFINITIONS

1.1 **"Proceeds"** shall mean the gross amount of any financial recovery, settlement, award, or judgment received by the Plaintiff as a result of the Lawsuit, **minus** any court fees, filing fees, and other standard disbursements deducted by the Plaintiff’s legal counsel, but **before** deduction of the Funder’s Share.

1.2 **"Funded Expenses"** shall mean specific invoices for legal costs or disbursements (e.g., expert witnesses, travel, specialized counsel fees) that the Funder agrees to pay directly or reimburse to the Plaintiff in addition to the Monthly Contribution.

1.3 **"Monthly Contribution"** shall mean the payment defined in Section 2.1.

## 2. FUNDER'S OBLIGATIONS

2.1 **Monthly Contribution:** The Funder agrees to pay the sum of **$1,000.00 CAD** (the "Monthly Contribution") directly to the Plaintiff’s legal counsel (or as otherwise directed by the Plaintiff) on or before the last day of each calendar month.

2.2 **Duration:** These Monthly Contributions shall commence on [Start Date] and continue until the conclusion of the Lawsuit, or until the agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms.

2.3 **Alternative Funding:** The Plaintiff reserves the right to terminate the Funder's obligation to make Monthly Contributions at any time by providing written notice that they have secured alternative funding or no longer require the contributions (the "Funding Termination"). Upon Funding Termination:
    (a) The Funder shall have no further obligation to make Monthly Contributions.
    (b) The Funder shall retain their right to the Standard Share (15%) and Expense Reimbursement defined in Section 3, provided they were not in Default at the time of Funding Termination.

2.3 **Additional Expenses:** The Funder may, at their sole discretion, agree to pay Funded Expenses upon submission of invoices by the Plaintiff or their counsel.

## 3. FUNDER'S RETURN

3.1 **Standard Share:** Subject to Section 3.3, in the event the Lawsuit is successful (by settlement, judgment, or otherwise), the Funder shall be entitled to receive **fifteen percent (15%)** of the Proceeds (the "Standard Share").

3.2 **Expense Reimbursement:** In addition to the Standard Share, the Funder shall be entitled to receive an amount equal to **two hundred percent (200%)** of the total Funded Expenses actually paid by the Funder (the "Expense Reimbursement").

3.3 **Living Expense Advances (Loan):** The Funder may, from time to time, advance funds directly to the Plaintiff for living expenses (the "Living Expense Advances"). The Parties explicitly agree that:
    (a) These advances are a **loan** repayable solely from the Proceeds of the Lawsuit.
    (b) In exchange for the risk of non-repayment, the Funder shall be entitled to receive an amount equal to **two hundred percent (200%)** of the total Living Expense Advances (the "Living Expense Reimbursement").
    (c) This Living Expense Reimbursement is in addition to the Standard Share and Expense Reimbursement.

3.4 **Exclusion of Monthly Contributions:** The Monthly Contributions described in Section 2.1 are the consideration for the Standard Share and are **NOT** included in the calculation of Funded Expenses or Living Expense Advances. The Funder shall not receive any reimbursement or multiplier on the Monthly Contributions beyond the Standard Share.

## 4. PENALTY FOR NON-PAYMENT

4.1 **Late or Missed Payment:** If the Funder fails to make any Monthly Contribution in full by the due date (the "Default"):
    (a) The Plaintiff shall provide written notice of the Default to the Funder.
    (b) The Funder may cure the Default by making the full payment within ten (10) days of such notice (the "Cure Period").
    (c) **Limit on Cures:** The Funder is entitled to exercise this Cure right **only once** in any rolling six (6) month period. If a second Default occurs within six (6) months of a previous cured Default, there shall be no Cure Period, and the penalty in Section 4.1(d) shall apply immediately.
    (d) If the Default is not cured within the Cure Period, or if no Cure Period applies pursuant to Section 4.1(c), the Standard Share defined in Section 3.1 shall immediately and permanently be reduced to **ten percent (10%)** (the "Reduced Share").
    (c) The Reduced Share shall apply to the entirety of the Proceeds, regardless of prior or subsequent compliance.

## 5. NO RECOURSE / RISK

5.1 **Non-Recourse Basis:** The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Funder’s recovery is **wholly contingent** upon the success of the Lawsuit. If there are no Proceeds recovered in the Lawsuit, the Plaintiff shall owe nothing to the Funder, and the Funder shall not be entitled to repayment of the Monthly Contributions or Funded Expenses.

5.2 **Acknowledgment of Risk:** The Funder acknowledges that litigation is uncertain and that they may lose their entire investment.

## 6. CONTROL OF LITIGATION

## 8. INDEPENDENT LEGAL ADVICE
