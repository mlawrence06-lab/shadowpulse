Suddenly, it's everywhere,&nbsp; <img src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/grin.gif\" alt=\"Grin\" border=\"0\"> It's getting harder and harder to know which one is for what. A small change on the icon adapted to the discussion would be useful, a different colour or maybe not complete the whole circle for discussions about development.<br></div>It sounds reasonable, but of those that could be used across various topics, I only see a few worthy emoji. But if we look at it through the lens of social identity, a single symbol for all threads + including the full domain name ... would ultimately benefit the project as a whole.<br></div><br>I think it would make the threads a lot more clearer if you put a one-word subject inside brackets, like this:<br><br><div class=\"codeheader\">Code:</div><div class=\"code\">[SIG] Γ¡ò BitList.co - lorem ipsum dolor sit amet<br></div><div class=\"codeheader\">Code:</div><div class=\"code\">[NINJASTIC] Γ¡ò BitList.co - lorem ipsum dolor sit amet<br></div><br><div class=\"codeheader\">Code:</div><div class=\"code\">[TELEGRAM BOT] Γ¡ò BitList.co - lorem ipsum dolor sit amet<br></div><br><div class=\"codeheader\">Code:</div><div class=\"code\">[ANN] Γ¡ò BitList.co - lorem ipsum dolor sit amet<br></div><br>or some variation of that.<br><br>Keep it short and simple, so it doesn't get cut off in the browser HTML.","date":"2025-12-08T13:34:58.000Z","board_id":84,"board_name":"Service Announcements","updated_at":"2025-12-08T13:35:00.971Z"}]}}
